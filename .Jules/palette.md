## 2024-05-18 - Added Contextual ARIA Labels to Project Links
**Learning:** Icon-only links within looping or repeated components (like `ProjectCard`) require dynamic, contextual `aria-label`s (e.g., `aria-label={\`Play \${project.title}\`}`). Generic labels like "Play" or "View on GitHub" become ambiguous when multiple instances exist on the same page.
**Action:** Always interpolate unique identifiers (like item titles or IDs) into `aria-label`s when mapping over arrays to generate interactive elements, ensuring screen reader users can distinguish between them.

## 2024-05-18 - Replacing `hidden` with `sr-only` for Screen Reader Support on Mobile
**Learning:** Using Tailwind's `hidden` class (e.g. `hidden sm:block`) on icon-link labels removes the element from both the visual layout *and* the accessibility tree on mobile. This makes the link appear completely empty to mobile screen reader users.
**Action:** Use `sr-only sm:not-sr-only` instead of `hidden sm:block` for text elements paired with icons inside links. This ensures the text remains visually hidden on mobile but fully accessible to screen readers, while displaying correctly on larger screens.
## 2024-05-18 - Adding title attributes to icon-only links for native tooltips
**Learning:** While `aria-label` provides essential accessibility for screen reader users on icon-only interactive elements, it does not provide any visual feedback to sighted mouse users. This can leave them guessing what an icon does if the icon is ambiguous.
**Action:** Always pair `aria-label` with a matching `title` attribute on icon-only links and buttons to provide a native browser tooltip on hover.
